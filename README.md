## Problem 1
##### This problem was recently asked by Google.
##### Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
##### For example, given ```[10, 15, 3, 7]``` and k of ```17```, return true since ```10 + 7``` is ```17```.

## Problem 2
##### This problem was asked by Uber.
##### Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of 
##### the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.  
##### For example, if our input was ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``, the expected output would be ``[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]``. 
##### If our input was ``[3, 2, 1]``, the expected output would be ``[2, 3, 6]``.  
##### Follow-up: what if you __can't use division__?

## Problem 25
##### Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:
#####  . (period) which matches any single character
#####  * (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element
##### That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and 
##### returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.
##### For example, given the regular expression ``"ra."`` and the string ``"ray"``, your function should return ``true``.
##### The same regular expression on the string ``"raymond"`` should return ``false``.
##### Given the regular expression ``".*at"`` and the string ``"chat"``, your function should return ``true``. 
##### The same regular expression on the string "chats" should return false.

## Problem 68

#####  This problem was asked by Google.
#####  On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.
#####  You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: ``(1, 2)`` is considered the same as ``(2, 1)``.
#####  For example, given ``M = 5`` and the list of bishops:
 ```
          (0, 0)
          (1, 2)
          (2, 2)
          (4, 0)
```
#####  The board would look like this:
#####
```
        [b 0 0 0 0]
        [0 0 b 0 0]
        [0 0 b 0 0]
        [0 0 0 0 0]
        [b 0 0 0 0]
```
##### You should return ``2``, since bishops ``1`` and ``3`` attack each other, as well as bishops ``3`` and ``4``.

## Problem 69
##### This problem was asked by Facebook.
##### Given a list of integers, return the __largest__ product that can be made by multiplying any _three integers_.
##### For example, if the list is ``[-10, -10, 5, 2]``, we should return ``500``, since that's ``-10 * -10 * 5``.
##### You can assume the list has at least three integers.

## Problem 70
##### This problem was asked by Microsoft.
##### A number is considered perfect if its __digits sum__ up to exactly ``10``.
##### Given a positive integer ``n``, return the ``n-th`` perfect number.
##### For example, given ``1``, you should return ``19``. Given ``2``, you should return ``28``.
