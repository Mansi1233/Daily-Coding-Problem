## Problem 1
##### This problem was recently asked by Google.
##### Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
##### For example, given ```[10, 15, 3, 7]``` and k of ```17```, return true since ```10 + 7``` is ```17```.

## Problem 25
##### Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:
#####  . (period) which matches any single character
#####  * (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element
##### That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and 
##### returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.
##### For example, given the regular expression ``"ra."`` and the string ``"ray"``, your function should return ``true``.
##### The same regular expression on the string ``"raymond"`` should return ``false``.
##### Given the regular expression ``".*at"`` and the string ``"chat"``, your function should return ``true``. 
##### The same regular expression on the string "chats" should return false.

## Problem 68

#####  This problem was asked by Google.
#####  On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.
#####  You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: ``(1, 2)`` is considered the same as ``(2, 1)``.
#####  For example, given ``M = 5`` and the list of bishops:
 ```
          (0, 0)
          (1, 2)
          (2, 2)
          (4, 0)
```
#####  The board would look like this:
#####
```
        [b 0 0 0 0]
        [0 0 b 0 0]
        [0 0 b 0 0]
        [0 0 0 0 0]
        [b 0 0 0 0]
```
##### You should return ``2``, since bishops ``1`` and ``3`` attack each other, as well as bishops ``3`` and ``4``.

## Problem 69
##### This problem was asked by Facebook.
##### Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.
##### For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.
##### You can assume the list has at least three integers.
